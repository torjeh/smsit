# Howto install 
# SMSit
#
#
# There is an install-script in the root directory called
# install.sh
#
# To execute it, run either
# chmod 755 install.sh
# sudo ./install.sh
#
# or
#
# sudo sh install.sh
#
#
# This will install 
# /etc/smsit.conf
# /etc/init.d/smsit
# /usr/local/bin/smsit.py
#
# and make SMSit start at boot-time
#
#
# Have fun!
