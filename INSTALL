# Howto install 
# SMSit
#
#
# There is an install-script in the root directory called
# install.sh
#
# To execute it, run either
# chmod 755 install.sh
# sudo ./install.sh
#
# or
#
# sudo sh install.sh
#
#
# This will install 
# /etc/smsit.conf
# /etc/init.d/smsit
# /user/local/bin/smsit.py
#
# and make SMSit start at boot-time
#
#
# The location of different files, can be changed in 
# /etc/smsit.conf after the install.
#
# If you change the location of the pid-file in /etc/smsit.conf,
# remember to also make the changes to /etc/init.d/smsit.
#
# If you want to change the location of the /etc/smsit.conf,
# you will have to make the change to the source code in smsit.py
