SMSit is not yet compatible with Mac OS X. Here is a list of some of the things that must be done to make it compatible:


- Need some other installation procedure
- Need to change the ping-call. Illegal option -w.
      > -t seems to be what we want in Mac OS
- Test gnokii for mac. Shouldn't be too much of a problem


For now, just use a Linux machine. Debian-based makes stuff easier ...
